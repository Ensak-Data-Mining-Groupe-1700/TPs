      "thank you for making this well done video sir\n",
      "If you already have a gaming PC, then the PS5 is the perfect way to go, since you already get Xbox exclusives on PC anyway. I have the PC and PS5 and  couldn't be happier with both!\n",

      "Great video as usual chap, Speaks volumes in my opinion that I've managed to sell 2 PS5's secondhand within hours of putting them on ebay, the Xbox series X (which has been used a lot less) though has sat there for two months now, even when reducing the price, makes me think these sales 'figures' are complete rubbish!.\n",

      "I went from Xbox 360 to the Xbox Series X. The load times and Quick Resume are insane features that completely change the gaming experience as a whole.\n",
      "Even after 6 months this is probably one of the best reviews for this topic, the smooth clear explanation for both the pros and cons for both consoles and the personal preference, and may I say your voice is great for these types of videos, personally I'm a Ps baby so I'm going Ps5, but I do respect Xbox, both great consoles, and once again amazing review \n",

      "Never seen such a honest and straight review you’ve earned my sub.\n",
      "In recent years I have come to respect both consoles. I own an Xbox and Halo has wrapped my heart, my friends all own Xboxes and PCs so it was a no brainer, but I couldn't be upset with either consoles as you said in the video. Honestly, the only missing piece of the puzzle I find with the Xbox is the fact that it's missing some exclusives. I wanted to get Horizon Zero Dawn, proceeded to the store on Xbox and found it nowhere. It bothered me, but I moved on.\n",
      "I’m quite curious since u played both consoles of all generations so I I’d love to know.. how do u manage to stop playing at a certain time for example if u have to go to work but u really want to complete something or have something that won’t be in the game forever? I’ve had a lot of trouble coming off at a good time\n",
      "I'm a huge PS fan but ended up with the Series X. But I'm actually really enjoying it so far. Game Pass is legit.\n",
      "Have the PS5, want the XSX, either way I'll be a happy woman come next year. \n",
      "Personally I agree with the channel on the controller for PS5, however with the difference in storage space, and the quick resume, along with Game Pass Ultimate,  the Series X  / S is my personal preference,  and what seals it for me is majority of my close friends are on Xbox since OG XBOX. However, I rrwlly do dig PS from PS and PS2 to current gen (which I have yet to find and buy) Sony does have PHENOMENAL GAMES that are Exclusive and I think they do have title's that I would buy the cinsole alone for!! Heck Demon Souls, God of War. Among plenty of others are console sellers for me alone! I really do love em both, but my Xbox does get more play over time consistently.. can't wait to find a PS5 New for retail!!\n",

      "My thing with the console war is how many controllers you go through and the amount of games available with one purchase. My friends with a ps4 or ps5 constantly go through controllers because of either the charger port started to bend down or the controller’s inputs on going through. And I used to play ps4 a lot for two years even though I’m a life king Xbox player, one thing I’ve noticed is PlayStation is that online competition is a lot easier. And I’ve played a lot of COD black ops 4, fortnite and apex. It was really easy to dominate compared to Xbox. One thing about PlayStation that I’ll give credit for is how the controller feels and responds, however I feel like all the mechanical parts that make the controller more advanced; break easier. I respect PlayStation but I’m an Xbox fan since the first Xbox. The fact that a jail broken Xbox can play old PlayStation games is hilarious when PlayStation is having a hard time with backwards compatibility.\n",

      "i’ve always bought playstation and i do prefer the ps5 more, but i still don’t really care about the other platforms as long as the owners are enjoying it. i still have my ps4 slim jet edition and it’s pretty good using ps plus extra which is amazing even tho it’s not better than the game pass. might wait for a ps5 slim so i can save some money and a smaller console\n",
      "I had an Xbox One and bought PS 5 for GoW Ragnarok and Ghost of Tsushima mainly. I liked better the design and also I didn't have a PS console so I thought it was about time. Still, I believe both are great consoles and it's only a matter of taste and which exclusives you prefer. \n",
      "I don't get it: if you attach an SSD to your PS5 console you won't be able to install PS5 games, just PS4 games? Or this was fixed with an update in the mean time?\n",

Seems to be a lot of noise made about the controller and for me it’s the exclusives on the PS that make the decision for me. Thanks again for vid \n",

      "I bought both too! Enjoy the best of both worlds for $1000. I do have my work laptop that can run basic games like sims etc. However, without shedding $3000, I can enjoy games like flight sim at 4K, and PlayStation exclusives\n",

      "Thank you for clearly answering the question from the beginning at the end. So many YouTubers blabla and don't tell you what they really think is better. I have a great PC (RTX 3070), so I picked the PS5 for the exclusives. Clear choice for me. But I just couldn't wait for the next gen, so I upgraded my PC. Otherwise I would also get both.\n",

(I like xbox) but i think that wouldve added a little extra something different than what the xbox one already had. Talking about when the lights turns on. Sams as on the cotroller that wouldve looked nice too i think, cause it pays more respect to xbox that its green also instead of white...more legendary looking.\n",

      "This was a good break down bro\n",
      "I use booth and I really prefer the Series X and the GamePass. But the main feature for me is Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. That is a Hughe difference and makes much more fun to play. - but my favourite next gen game is Forbidden West, so also the PS5 was played In the last 16 month ((;\n",

      "To fully experience both companys vision of gaming you have to dabble in both\n",
      "I chose the Xbox recently because my friends that have the ps5 say they are switching to PC soon. I don’t see why a couple of my friends should dictate what I get. Sure I’ll play cross platform games with them but at the end of the day I wanted to make the switch because the Xbox is easier to get and you can play 99% of the same games that you can play of PlayStation. My ps4 was having software issues and I don’t think it will last longer so I pulled the trigger on this new Xbox to start my next Gen gaming. Maybe down the road I will purchase a ps5\n",

It wouldn't be a problem if my laptop's GPU didn't suck but it does and I can only play Forza Horizon 4 at 1600 x 900 p 30 FPS and Forza Horizon 5 at 720p 30 FPS which makes my fans pretty hot. Guess I'm gonna either wait a while to get a more powerful PC for Forza or wait for a more powerful PC and wait for Spider-Man 2 to hopefully come to PC.\n",

      "My 1st console was the original PS.  Loved it so much that I stayed with them and upgraded to PS2.  Somewhere in there I picked up a used xbox because my 1st Lan party with Halo just blew me away.  Then 3rd gen consoles came and both the price of games and consoles went above what I was willing to spend at that time so I turned to Nintendo and was happy to play their handheld systems.  Getting the Xbox series X was an easy decision for me.  I have Nintendo Switch for my exclusives, strategy, and rpg needs while the Xbox satisfied my craving for FPS and games that required higher processing and graphical power.\n",
      "The PS5 does have a couple of exclusives on my wishlist, and I've been a PS guy pretty much my whole life, as I own every PS console but this one. I will also get the Series S as well, mainly because of Play Anywhere titles that I got on Windows, it's compact size for easy portability and most importantly; Halo Infinite\n",

Besides all of that, I don’t have the space for the ps5 as it doesn’t work with my entertainment cabinet setup\n",

      "I’m looking at getting one of these this week and aren’t sure what to get. They’re both good and I was originally just going to get a PlayStation but what’s holding me back is that Microsoft now owns a lot of big developers that I like. Bethesda, blizzard, ID etc so I’m really not sure what to get at this point\n",
      "Like you, I enjoy both consoles. Both have their own features that really make the experience all about preference. Great video, thank you as always.\n",
      "I’m honestly glad they didn’t change the UI of the series X. It works, it’s smooth and I know it. And both are Fantastic machines. You can’t go wrong either way. Since all my friends are on Xbox, I went with the series X. However, I’m definitely going to get a ps5 sooner or later\n",
      "Actually, there both really good and fascinating!\n",

Also because the PS5 has Rift Apart, which actually became my number one favorite game, after Sly 2 had held the crown for over a decade. Each console has advantages over the other, but in the end, it's all up to preference and your preferred style of games. For me, singleplayer games are my favorite, which is why I also prefer PlayStation over Xbox; it has the greater selection of singleplayer games (Sly Cooper, Crash Bandicoot (until Crash 4), Ratchet & Clank, LittleBigPlanet (mostly)), while Xbox has the greater selection of multiplayer games\n",

PS2 was my first Playstation I owned back in early 2000s, ran with that for a few years and have found memories with it, switched over to Xbox 360 in 2007, had a blast with that console played awesome games on it and enjoyed it just as much as I did the PS2.  2015 I switched back to Playstation (4), had a good time with those games.  Bought the Xbox One in 2019 so I could play the Gears 4 & 5 (Gears is my favorite game series ever).  And thats where I currently sit.  I know at some point in time I'll eventually own both PS5 and Xbox Series X, but that'll be awhile, can't go blowing money on gaming like some people can, got a family and bills to worry about, but I think I'm going with Xbox Series X first, that way I'll have it when Gears 6 eventually comes out lol.\n",

      "I think both of these consoles will go down as great consoles. The PS5 is the better option at launch mainly because of the exclusives actually being present (the duel sense is fantastic too). But I think by the end of the generation, the Series X will be considered the better console because of its superior power, smaller size and the games it will have (although those games will be playable on PC). Just my thoughts, I’m looking to start a discussion. Great review\n",
      "Ive also had both consoles since PS1 and Original Xbox. i have both for the exact same reasons but i have about 600+ games built up over the years on my xbox account it is a multiplayer heaven.

Didn’t have an Xbox console but playing on my tv, what a service (cloud). So impressed I’ve bought an X. Still think PS has more games to my taste but quite happy to sit out the 5 this generation and see what PS brings next gen.\n",
      "Depends on if you want a spaceship. You want a college refrigerator.\n",
      "Used to be an XBoX player, and then my friends introduced me to all the exclusives, and I used to be like “nahhhhh, but HALOOO”, and then I played The Last of Us, soon, I started playing God of War, yeah, bye bye XBOX, we had a good run\n",
      "For my personal budget I grabbed an Xbox series x primarily because of game pass which has been an amazing experience . Hopefully after tax season I’ll be able to find a ps5 . The Sony exclusives are the one thing that I’m missing on my Xbox but having both of them along with the switch would be a harmony of mathematical precision lol I think all consoles are wonderful in their perspective but together it’s gamers paradise .\n",
      "Just get my hands on PS5 after a long hunt. I find the shape of the console is weird looking, so I have to hide it in my cupboard. However, the controller and a docking station is a real show stopper to me so I showcase them on a shelve while charging.\n",

      "I moved from PS4 to series X and I love it no regrets at all\n",
      "It’s a very tough decision because they both have some great features as well as exclusive games. Another decision point is your TV’s gaming capabilities and in that respect the Xbox Series X is a bit more flexible with its 1440p @ 120Hz because there’s damn few TV’s that are capable of doing a full 4K @ 120Hz. I don’t know which one I’m buying yet, still smh\n",
      "It really boils down to which exclusives you prefer.\n",
      "They’re both great consoles. It all boils down to preference of games for me. That’s about it…\n",
      "I like the PS5 more, but all my data and friends are on Xbox. So I’ll be going with the Series X.\n",
      "I would like to start by saying I have or rather had both systems until I decided on the Series X which is a better system.\n",
      "I love the fact that he has LEGO marvel\n",
      "I personally love the Xbox so the Series X is obviously the console I would pick but in my opinion, the Xbox is the clear winner as it is very easy to use and the controller just feels more comfortable for me. Another thing is that it is almost the same layout as the old gen which makes it much easier to transition.\n",
      "The PS5 controller does look good but for me Microsoft have played a blinder with GamePass and I also like how they're integrating windows and xbox closer all the time. I think this will ultimately give them the edge over the lifetime of this generation.\n",
      "I low-key feel like people on ps5 are gonna forget that there mics on the remote and leave them on all the time in online games lol\n",
      "I have the Xbox Series X and I just ordered the PS5 a few days ago, but I'm dreading how awful it will look on my shelf compared to the much more discrete XSX.\n",
      "Honestly I think which one you are better at more\n",

      "I like all and finally a viedo we’re fanboys don’t exist\n",
      "I think I’m gonna switch over to the Xbox it just seems better overall in my opinion\n",
      "I think there is a clear winner (ps5) but if you're on the fence, I would choose what your friends play, and what games you want to play\n",
      "Sony really lost out with series S. A next gen console with nearly the same features as the series X, for 299 is amazing.\n",
      "I have both, and for me the only difference are the exclusives, I prefer the exclusives on PlayStation, but if I had to choose the best contender, I’d choose Xbox because you can customize your Home Screen, they both are extremely premium consoles and are pretty much neck and neck\n",

      "I grew up on playing Xbox .. but this ps5 is insane . Got mines last night in the mail & i am impressed . Controller feels great .. looks great ... the gaming is so real\n",
      "I personally rather get ps5 over a mini fridge\n",
      "I haven't used my Series X once since building a PC which is a shame since things like quick resume and smart delivery are phenomenal features. There's just no incentive to play on a Series X for me because I don't have a HDMI 2.1 TV. It's still a great console though and the controlled has to be one of my all time favourites even if they get stuck drift after 6 months of regular use. I'm considering getting a PS5 but I hate Sony lol\n",
      "I love Multi-Plats on my Xbox,  and I like Sony for Single Player Games. I prefer the Xbox.\n",
      "I have both currently and I totally agree with you. I got the Xbox first and was really pleased with the experience however it felt like just another Xbox. Than when I got the ps5 everything was just more modern and next gen feeling. And those exclusives are just way too fun bro. Also dual sense is honesty amazing as well. Sony definitely delivered this generation however the Xbox isn’t even bad and it’s good as well but the ps5 is just so cool lol.\n",
      "ps5 vs xbox. After watching this, they both sound good, and I will get both. I don't want to miss out on playing games that aren't on one console. if I had to choose 1, it's the ps5. I enjoyed the ps2 growing up\n",
      "I have had great memories with both Xbox and PlayStation consoles throughout the years. I was able to get a series X about a year after they came out for MSRP then fast forward about 6 months and I finally got a PS5 off of stockX. It was about 600 which isn't bad at all. Both consoles of this gen are incredible and we haven't even scratched the surface of their capabilities. Plus they look great side by side as there is such a massive contrast in design between them. \n",

      "I haven't really experienced Xbox to the fullest just a few times when I went outdoors but in my home I own the ps4pro and I love it but now I'm having mixed feelings about the past because of xbox's game pass\n",
      "I've always been a playstation guy and I like the almost futuristic look of the Ps5 but I gotta respect xbox and Microsoft. That game pass is a great idea.\n",
      "just get an elite controller like one of the new ones ive got one for my xbox and it’s heaps good\n",
      "personally I prefer the black brick, still playing the one x, hope to get the x series sometime.\n",
      "For those who are wanting only 1 you have to ask yourself just how much do you want to play games? If you’re about lots of games and not really consistent in the time given into one game, Xbox Series X with Game Pass Ultimate is a huge value as you’ll never be out of stuff to play. If you are committed to playing a handful of games and buy most of the games you play, PS5 is the best option because they simply have the best single player experiences. I’ve got both and I have PS Plus Premium and Game Pass Ultimate. I play both pretty equally but I’ll say that if a game is multi platform I get it on Xbox because they support 120 fps better than the PS5 and they also have Dolby Vision in gaming which is a huge boost for me since I have an HDMI 2.1 TV which supports DV. Both are amazing consoles though and honestly like he said in this review you won’t be disappointed with either. My preferred is Xbox just cause I’ve got more invested into the ecosystem. Once Sony improves their service portion to better match value to Game Pass it may change though.\n",
      "i like the playstation exclusives a hell of a lot more, spesifically uncharted, but damn i might as well keep my ps4 cause im really leaning torwars the xbox. the controller looks much better in my opinion, and while im not the biggest fan of the console look i really dont like how the ps5 has a combination of white and black colors because idk white controllers and systems have always looked better on the xbox while midnight black systems and controllers have always looked sleaker. obviously there are faceplates and different colored controllers, but im just upset i cant get an all midnight black ps5 right out of the box! the interface was a big turn off for me too. while im not a huge fan or forza or gears of war, halo has always been pretty decent and backwards compatability is amazing since there are some 360 titles i have been dying to play like rdr1, gta4 amd halo 3. i own a ps4 currently and i really love it and most of my friends are on it but idk i just feel so much more drawn to the xbox this gen. what do you guys think i should do? pick up an xbox and dive into a whole new world or pick up a playstation to continue my journey with the brand?\n",
      "For me I don’t play heavy games so I got the Series S. It’s fine for me and it still get 120 FPS. If your plating on a monitor, ittl be fine because 1080p is the most common.\n",

      "I had the PS4 and upgraded to the PS4 Pro. I have never owned an Xbox. But I was looking to switch this generation. The capabilities of Series X and the games available thru game pass were just too good to pass up. It helps that Microsoft is buying all the developers, too. But I ended up getting both systems so I can play my favorite Sony exclusives and utilize the DualSense controller/3DPulse sound. I’m looking forward to this generation!\n",

But I also like the advantages of the Series X if it gets cheaper and gets more good exclusives over the years I will also buy one.\n",
      "I like a lot of the changes in hardware engineering and company presentation that there's been with Xbox over the last few years. They've now got a unified philosophy of choice, communication with gamers, quality engineering, value for money on Games Pass. They hit every spot now, other than certain Sony-specific epics like The Last Guardian. Choose what kind of device you game on. Choose what price point you want to pay for a console. Choose (when Xbox Design Labs resumes) the colour scheme and, to a certain extent, the texture, of your controller (there might be other changes, I assume). Making their box look like a PC tower is logical and fitting for what their console can do graphically. Sony, by contrast, continue to offer less personalisation. Sony/their studios are brilliant storytellers but I feel like I would write my own story more on Xbox. That's Xbox's 'heir to Dreamcast' nature - and it's why Xbox and Nintendo are similar. Games don't have to be so often so human interest story-heavy although I appreciate Xbox making moves to do so e.g. The Medium.\n",

It has been over 2 decades, and Microsoft doesn't even try to improve on it\n",

Xbox is lacking games and I’m anxiously waiting for the Halo edition of the Xbox. And so far the PS5 has been 100% worth it. It’s definitely an upgrade and it doesn’t feel in any way like last gen. It sucks that it is suffering from the scalper plague, but I highly recommend it to anyone who can get one. As for the Xbox I have huge expectations though I wouldn’t dare review it since I don’t own one yet.\n",

I am tempted to buy both consoles due to my age, I am 51 this year and potentially this could be the last generation that I buy, so as I have always supported both consoles in the past, it might be nice to go out supporting both consoles.

Playstation is doubling down on the walled-garden approach to keep people buying their brand through sunken cost and social ostricization (perpetuating the console wars, really).  No brainer, Microsoft is the one doing far better on supporting multiple platforms and opening the experinece to a larger audience, including online.\n",

And before people say \"Well Playstation games are now on PC also\" yeah you're right, but after they've been out for a while on console plus the new consoles run the Playstation games better anyways.

And most of my friends have PlayStation or PC but I still think Xbox is very nice just one thing I really don’t like is they still use batteries for controllers which is not only expensive but all the batteries we throw out unless u get a rechargeable controller but the console wars have always angered me because both consoles are great. But PC is always better in my opinion \n",

The controller was okay but I actually prefer the ps4 controller. That's my opinion anyhow everyone has their own.\n",

The only games I like are snowrunner, the fifth element, airblade, blast corps, perfect dark, goldeneye and all the desert strike games, like jungle strike and urban strike. the problem is air blade and fifth element games are not available on the ps store so I had to use my original ps2 for those two games. I like kurushi and abes odyssey as well but they are on the ps store anyway... and goldeneye is meant to be coming but I am doubting that as they have been saying it for years and still it's not here. my point I don't see the point in me buying any of these consoles unless stated games are addes to these. don't like many modern games I tried but snowrunner is a fantastic game because it reminds me a bit of the desert strike games except you don't kill anyone. It's a map and a load of missions etc the same as the desert strike games. I wish they would remaster these games I love them.\n",

      "I have both, mind you I'm not very technically inclined. I like the ps5 controller more, especially for shooters, probably an overall better gaming experience. That being said, game pass is a hard deal to beat. You can buy an Xbox and for only $15 a month, you can play halo, titanfall, destiny, battlefield, etc. I enjoyed playing on my ps5 but I don't feel the minor better experience is enough to outdo game pass\n",

      "If we are talking about the content, ps5 is better, the games Xbox has are fairly limited and the exclusives aren’t as big as PS, now Xbox S/X is a goddamn beauty of a system, the Home Screen navigation and the fact that it has a press and hold to turn off is something that’s familiar since the ps4 and previous gen had, PS now doesn’t have it which isn’t a big deal but it took me a while to figure out how to turn it off, the Xbox controller is definitely better but the Duel Sense is so much better than the previous gen, the fact that the triggers are harder to push down ONLY WHEN PLAYING A GAME is weird at first after I noticed it but it’s awesome none the less because when you’re not playing a game the duel shock triggers are smooth to push and then when in game harder to push, I wonder how they made that work or if I’m the only one who noticed. I prefer ps based on exclusives and that’s pretty much it. Both are fucking beastie boys, heavy fucking consoles which is definitely surprising because all previous gens were half the weight. But also PS doesn’t have the same storage which sucks, but I have a 4T SSD but from what I’ve heard you still can’t connect them to the new system which is ridiculous\n",

Add that together with the fact that you can change the look of the ps5 with the removable plates that you can attach new ones that are different colors.

      "The storage cards are more expensive on the Xbox. £150 for 1Tb but only £80 on the PS5. I also think the PS5 is more refined on the graphics. Both are 4K but I do see a smoother difference. I should’ve kept my Xbox One X. It’s 4k and the upgraded for Series X Xbox one games  work on it and you can still store them on a HD drive. You can’t on the Series X. They have to be stored on the SD card which are expensive. So keep your Xbox one X and get a PS5 for the new generation games.\n",

It’s horizontal on my large table top unit which is wide enough for my 55 inch qled, my ps5,my ps4 pro and my Xbox one x. My ps5 on the left side of my tv, my ps4 pro on the right side and the one x below the tv in middle storage area of the unit.  All my wires are well hidden and the whole set up looks tidy, contemporary and Elegant. I chose not to get a series x. The ps5 just meets all my current gen gaming needs and just has the better games. Series x offers quantity over quality with its game pass option but PlayStation offers quality over quantity with its console exclusives. \n",

They are the same people who would choose to go to a buffet and eat low quality food over going to a quality restaurant and having a 3 course meal. The Xbox one x game pass is like a buffet. Lots of food that random people are breathing over. Food that has been left out and is Luke warm in temperature. Just a few quality food items and the rest party type finger foods to fool your stomach and fill you up. I keep it simple. I get the best ps5 games for the best current gen gaming experience just like how I prefer fine dining over party type finger foods at the local all you can eat buffet\n",

      "So I will have both of them\n",
      "Ps5 vs Xbox Series X. My choose will be Xbox. Only because of game pass. Ps5 design is really hype. But the main reason people purchase game. Only for gaming. Thats why you need to have a better library of games. Instead of just fancy hardware. Just my opinion.\n",
      "The best console is which ever you like to use. I , playstation. But if you are for Xbox and you can afford it . Pick up ps5 for at least horizon forbidden West. You won't regret it !\n",
      "PS5 period... Since the xbox one showcase, I don't even consider the xbox an option anymore... I liked the 360 though <3\n",
      "The best one to get is the one you can actually buy.\n",
      "PS5 vs XBox ... I have the XBox Series S, so not familiar with the PS5 myself.\n",
      "Xbox i  prefer  but I all waz buy the two of them  Love Both exclusives, love  the exclusive and xbox and PlayStation\n",
      "Gotta go with the PS5. Not only does it have better exclusives, the crossplatform games work better on dualsense. Getting the Series XS version of a game means you're getting an inferior port of said game due to the loss of adaptive triggers features.\n",
      "I love it when people try both consoles and don’t just MEAT RIDE Sony or Microsoft :)\n",
      "I both are great tbh\n",
      "The x is the better choice and I have both BTW. Both are good though it's all personal preference.\n",
      "Ps5 is just so clean futuristic asf and the Xbox will always be a classic but the ps5 just seems more legendary imo. The new dual sense \n",
      "I don’t really know which is better but the ps5 controller is better than the Xbox controller. The ps5 is a good console though I had one I haven’t had a x so i don’t know\n",
      "After 13 years gaming on an xbox, I had to get a ps5 to try some new games!\n",
      "Problem with ps5 is the pricing.  Especially lately.. they're insanely high\n",
      "Coming from an xbox owner and lover Playstation definitely has the better exclusives.\n",
      "Bro forgot to mention Horizon Zero dawn and Horizon Forbidden West as PlayStation exclusives. Some of the best games of all time hands down\n",
      "I chose the ps5 bc i chose ps4 last time and i like the look of the ps5 i also i prefer a lot of the exclusives\n",
      "Depends. You want crazy exclusives? PlayStation 5. You want a bigger and better catalogue extended past the current generation? Xbox Series X. Choose wisely folks. Or maybe don’t choose at all lol…..and buy both\n",
      "I prefer both.\n",
      "Yeah, PlayStation 5 definitely wins with the controller as far as what it does, but I’ve always preferred Xbox controllers. Based on the info, I’d get a Series X…\n",
      "\n",
      "But retro gaming is far better!\n",
      "I own ps5 and I'm thinking of getting a series x.\n",
      "For anyone who doesn't have one,\n",
      "Ps5: better exclusives, better controller, better audio engine\n",
      "Xsx: straight up more powerful, most powerful gaming console ever made. Game pass, quick resume, and more base storage than ps5\n",
      "Ps5 all day after experiencing Xbox X They need to do some upgrading when you are searching for games they Look all blurry everything just seems so old school and when I was playing on PS five everything is so crispy and nice looking 4K all the way Xbox needs to do some catching up\n",
      "If I had to sale one\n",
      "PlayStation 5 I’d get more money because it’s a hard find meaning more money\n",
      "Series X I could find one in a month or so I wouldn’t be to hurt not playing for a month or so.\n",
      "Being honest, didn’t taste play station 5, but the tide with the Xbox is high.., the size, the game cathalog.., maybe people say that as machine play station 5 is more powerful,..\n",
      "so, based off this video, i have come to my own personal conclusion that xbox is, essentially, iPhone, and playstation is Samsung. \n",
      "Considering the new xbox is so similar to xbox one, i may just continue with xbox one S and buy a PS5. \n",
      "i’m not a hardcore gamer, so i’m thinking that’s the best route to go for myself. i’ll gladly read any non-bias counterclaims though (:\n",
      "Nowadays with the massive shortages of PS5, we dont really have much of choice now\n",
      "Yes I would choose the Xbox but I like PlayStation too\n",
      "I am a xbox guy. So I got the series x my roommate has a ps5 and I enjoy playing it too.\n",
      "I like more ps5 but I'll give my respect to xbox series x because I use it now and it's still a great console.the reason I like more the Playstation is the exclusives and because all my friends have a Playstation and I want to play with them.Guys always remember when you play with your friends you dont have to care about the fps or the graphics the only thing you have to care is to have fun, because the purpose of video games is to have fun always remember that\n",
      "I think all of us that own both systems know the answer to this. There are so many less hoops to jump through with Microsoft.\n",
      "Gosh would these console wars just stop the ps5 and xbox series x/s are the same\n",
      "After decades of me being with playstation and never owning an xbox. I'm now leaning toward x box. Please someone advise if am making a mistake.\n",
      "Fair point but I’ll have to stay with Xbox I’ve played that for about 9 years\n",
      "U MISSED MICROSOFT FLIGHT SIMULATOR 20\n",
      "I can't believe you have to put batteries in the xbox controller, wtf ?\n",
      "Specs and design: Xbox \n",
      "Overall: ps5 cause it has more and better exclusives and the controller is better \n",
      "Both consoles are good though\n",
      "No debate. Both are great consoles. But for me of course playstation. It's my childhood nostalgia. I've grown up with it  but the only thing i don't like about playstation nowadays is the storage they provide not much. Only 800+ gigabyte? Come on Sony with  the money we pay high for the console, you can give 1 terabyte. And one more thing is the cd games getting expensive. So ashamed \n",
      "I got a 1TB SSD for the PS5 for $145. It's faster than the console's. And I wanna get a little external for my PS4 games.\n",
      "Really happy with my PS5, but the looks of the Xbox are superior. If it had Sony's games, I would have gotten the Xbox\n",
      "Xbox user mate I love it and the controllers analogue placement is better than ps5\n",
      "Same I like Xbox and PlayStation they are not bad consuls\n",
      "on xbox I have the offer with game pass and I think that is a plus\n",
      "PS5 vs XBOX\n",
      "Availability! Almost bought a xbox because I was fed up of waiting for a PS5. Think it comes down to console exclusives really. I personally think Sony have better exclusives\n",
      "The one that you can actually use because it has games to play on:/\n",
      "Power and graphics, the series X has been proven to be better, same since the original Xbox and ps2 all the way until now\n",
      "I like the Xbox more than the PlayStation 5\n",
      "Xbox gold and pc is all you need no Xbox s required\n",
      "I love both but the Xbox has always had the edge for me\n",
      "Tbh as the years passed, PS5 has surpassed the  Xbox even further it feels like.\n",
      "Even though I like Xbox more Without my bias I still think that Series x is better because of the download speeds and graphs plus it looos like a frigid\n",
      "ratchet and clank also is a PS exclusive\n",
      "Ps5 is the way to go\n",
      "The futuristic look and the new controler look and features are awesome \n",
      "The funny thing is, PS5 just released ps plus extra and premium so ps is obviously a clear winner.\n",
      "As intrigued as I am by the PS5, I just don't have it in me to go for one (especially since I've been known to skip PS generations, since I have both a PS2 and PS4, but I don't have either a PS1 or PS3), so I'll just have to settle with my Xbox Series X for now. (Or, as I like to call it, the \"XBEAST\"!)\n",
      "If you like subscription services get an Xbox but if you like exclusive games and owning the games you play than get a PlayStation.\n",
      "Here in Europe I don't know single person who plays xbox\n",
      "For me, I would say the Xbox series x is better since I was able to get one. Still don't know when we're getting PS5''s.\n",
      "PS5 vs Xbox\n",
      "Playstation has ALWAYS been more focused on the best Exclusive games that aren’t just racing, sports, or online shoot multiplayers. Playstation has allll the best games\n",

      "It only matters what you like not what anyone likes.\n",
      "Sony has nice cinematic games but overall Microsoft has more for the buck\n",

      "Any american here, can you say the second hand price of ps5??..\n",
      "In my opinion the Xbox series x is the better system by far. Everyone just seemed to jump over to PlayStation the last generation when they had a meltdown because the Xbox one was going to be all digital. Microsoft quickly changed their minds but the damage was already done even though nowadays its mostly digital anyways and that's what most people prefer\n",
      "I mean I really like the Xbox controller and the graphics are better but I like the games for ps5\n",
      "Ps5 for me is easy choice I can’t live without the exclusive of Sony\n",
      "PS5 has the best controller and also the best BY FAR exclusive games. Hardwearewise X Box is way better, Game Pass is amazing, but sony exclusives, there lays the gap between them\n",

      "PS5 has some great looking next gen games the XBSX does game pass really well if you like online gaming that is the go too for it but does not have any real next gen games but the XBSX looks better than the PS5 both are great consoles but if you like single player games and online then play PC, crossplay on XBSX is forced in most of the big online games but PSN you can turn it off who wants to play against sweaty PC players alot of them use hacks.\n",
      "Ps5 is better but the thing I love about Xbox is that they give the game pass and u can play games for free but overall ps5 is better\n",

      "The Xbox series x is way better because of the 1tb storage and quick resume of games\n",
      "Xbox always had the better controller and as far as games go God of war is the only ps exclusive I care about tbh gears halo those are really good games cause you can play solo or coop you have the option which all games should have imo we are in 2022 let's make this the year where games are great again. I like both consoles but imo xbox wins they have pioneered so many online features then ps. Gaming is a hobby no matter what console we use we all share the love for gaming dont matter if it ps xbox PC switch etc. They are all great wish I could own em all. Tbh xbox ever since they switch CEOs back when that abysmal announcement of the xbox one where you control cable has been getting better and better cant wait for the future hell its Microsoft great software company what you expect.\n",

Yet PS5 is still out of stock in their website and nowhere to be found in any shops (here in Singapore) except from scalpers asking you to top-up $100+ of its MSRP. 3 years mind you!
