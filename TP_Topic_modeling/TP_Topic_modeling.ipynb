       "array([\"  Predictive models allow subject-specific inference when analyzing disease\\nrelated alterations in neuroimaging data. Given a subject's data, inference can\\nbe made at two levels: global, i.e. identifiying condition presence for the\\nsubject, and local, i.e. detecting condition effect on each individual\\nmeasurement extracted from the subject's data. While global inference is widely\\nused, local inference, which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps,\\nis rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of\\ndispersed isolated islands. In this article, we propose a reconstruction\\nmethod, named RSM, to improve subject-specific detections of predictive\\nmodeling approaches and in particular, binary classifiers. RSM specifically\\naims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite\\nsample of examples to train classifiers. The proposed method is a wrapper-type\\nalgorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic\\nmanner, i.e. without information on condition presence. Reconstruction is posed\\nas a Maximum-A-Posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are\\nestimated from training data in a classifier-specific fashion. Experimental\\nevaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the\\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Results on\\nsynthetic data demonstrate that using RSM yields higher detection accuracy\\ncompared to using models directly or with bootstrap averaging. Analyses on the\\nADNI dataset show that RSM can also improve correlation between\\nsubject-specific detections in cortical thickness data and non-imaging markers\\nof Alzheimer's Disease (AD), such as the Mini Mental State Examination Score\\nand Cerebrospinal Fluid amyloid-$\\\\beta$ levels. Further reliability studies on\\nthe longitudinal ADNI dataset show improvement on detection reliability when\\nRSM is used.\\n\",\n",

       "       '  \"Three is a crowd\" is an old proverb that applies as much to social\\ninteractions, as it does to frustrated configurations in statistical physics\\nmodels. Accordingly, social relations within a triangle deserve special\\nattention. With this motivation, we explore the impact of topological\\nfrustration on the evolutionary dynamics of the snowdrift game on a triangular\\nlattice. This topology provides an irreconcilable frustration, which prevents\\nanti-coordination of competing strategies that would be needed for an optimal\\noutcome of the game. By using different strategy updating protocols, we observe\\ncomplex spatial patterns in dependence on payoff values that are reminiscent to\\na honeycomb-like organization, which helps to minimize the negative consequence\\nof the topological frustration. We relate the emergence of these patterns to\\nthe microscopic dynamics of the evolutionary process, both by means of\\nmean-field approximations and Monte Carlo simulations. For comparison, we also\\nconsider the same evolutionary dynamics on the square lattice, where of course\\nthe topological frustration is absent. However, with the deletion of diagonal\\nlinks of the triangular lattice, we can gradually bridge the gap to the square\\nlattice. Interestingly, in this case the level of cooperation in the system is\\na direct indicator of the level of topological frustration, thus providing a\\nmethod to determine frustration levels in an arbitrary interaction network.\\n',\n",

The combined observations of the(ionized, atomic, molecular, dusty)\\ninterstellar medium (ISM) with star formation tracers (HII regions, young\\n<10Myr stellar clusters) suggest (1) no variation in giant molecular cloud\\n(GMC) properties between arm and gas spurs, (2) gas spurs and extinction\\nfeathers arising from the same structure with a close spatial relation between\\ngas spurs and ongoing/recent star formation (despite higher gas surface\\ndensities in the spiral arm), (3) no trend in star formation age either along\\nthe arm or along a spur, (4) evidence for strong star formation feedback in gas\\nspurs: (5) tentative evidence for star formation triggered by stellar feedback\\nfor one spur, and (6) GMC associations (GMAs) being no special entities but the\\nresult of blending of gas arm/spur cross-sections in lower resolution\\nobservations.

The iHS procedure is applied to a second-order\\nspatial discretization of the TWEs derived on an unstructured grid with\\nstaggered grid arrangement. The momentum equation only is extended to the\\ncenter of each IB face where pressure and velocity components are co-located\\nand treated as unknowns. One closure condition considered for the iHS is the\\nassignment of the surface gradient of pressure phase over the IBs,\\ncorresponding to assigning the shape of the acoustic waveform at the IB.

We first take a look at the\\nalgebraic description of both classical and quantum observables in terms of\\nJordan-Lie algebras and show how the two algebraic structures are the precise\\nmathematical manifestation of the two-fold role of observables. Then, we turn\\nto the geometric reformulation of quantum kinematics in terms of Kähler\\nmanifolds. A key achievement of this reformulation is to show that the two-fold\\nrole of observables is the constitutive ingredient defining what an observable\\nis.

To efficiently deal with the chance SINR\\nconstraint, we employ the sample approximation method to convert them into\\nfinitely many linear constraints. Then, we propose a convex approximation based\\ndeflation algorithm for solving the sample approximation JPAC problem.

       "       '  A ROSAT survey of the Alpha Per open cluster in 1993 detected its brightest\\nstar, mid-F supergiant Alpha Persei: the X-ray luminosity and spectral hardness\\nwere similar to coronally active late-type dwarf members. Later, in 2010, a\\nHubble Cosmic Origins Spectrograph SNAPshot of Alpha Persei found\\nfar-ultraviolet coronal proxy SiIV unexpectedly weak. This, and a suspicious\\noffset of the ROSAT source, suggested that a late-type companion might be\\nresponsible for the X-rays. Recently, a multi-faceted program tested that\\npremise. Groundbased optical coronography, and near-UV imaging with HST Wide\\nField Camera 3, searched for any close-in faint candidate coronal objects, but\\nwithout success. Then, a Chandra pointing found the X-ray source single and\\ncoincident with the bright star. Significantly, the SiIV emissions of Alpha\\nPersei, in a deeper FUV spectrum collected by HST COS as part of the joint\\nprogram, aligned well with chromospheric atomic oxygen (which must be intrinsic\\nto the luminous star), within the context of cooler late-F and early-G\\nsupergiants, including Cepheid variables. This pointed to the X-rays as the\\nfundamental anomaly. The over-luminous X-rays still support the case for a\\nhyperactive dwarf secondary, albeit now spatially unresolved. However, an\\nalternative is that Alpha Persei represents a novel class of coronal source.\\nResolving the first possibility now has become more difficult, because the easy\\nsolution -- a well separated companion -- has been eliminated. Testing the\\nother possibility will require a broader high-energy census of the early-F\\nsupergiants.\\n',\n",

This supersedes the\\ncurrent understanding that a critical mass density ($m^*\\\\approx$ 0.54) alone\\ntriggers the sudden onset of vigorous vibrations.
